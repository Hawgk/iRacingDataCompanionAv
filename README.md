# iRacing Data Companion
This is a tool.

It's written in C# using .NET 8.0 and AvaloniaUI. Was kinda an experiment to get to know Avalonia a bit better. Might port it to OpenGL/DirectX at some later stage.

One of those things it can do is read data from iRacing SDK.

Also it paints pixels.

All those pixels combined resemble a standings view, relative view and fuel calculator.

Don't look into the code please.

## Special Thanks
[iRon](https://github.com/lespalt/iRon/) - Thanks for those relatives mate.

[IRSDKSharper](https://github.com/mherbold/IRSDKSharper) - Thanks for the awesome C# wrapper.

iRacing Team - Thanks for giving us a sim that is freaking awesome. (but come on we shouldn't have to pay monthly(?????) for 3rd party overlays)
